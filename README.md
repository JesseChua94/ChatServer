# ChatServer

A Java IRC-like chat server with support for custom rooms, admins, ids, and lots of commands. 
The biggest limitation is that users can only be in one room at a time. If I were to redo this, I would try to add message encryption (why not?) and clean up how rooms are handled. 

Built by Ethan Madison in 2014 for a school project.
